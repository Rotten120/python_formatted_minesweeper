This is a version of the my repo 'MineSweeper' that follows standard code formatting.
It specifically follows the ff.
1. Use of snake case for variable, file, folder, and repo naming
2. Use of pascal case for class naming
3. Minimizing use of single character variables

Nonetheless, the code still works similarly to the other repository.
